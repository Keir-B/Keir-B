Problem 1: Word Character Replacement
input: 1 string, 2 words. Replace second word with '*'
Create a C++ program that takes a text input containing two words and replaces all the characters of the second word with '*'. For example, if the input is "hello world," the program should output "hello *****."

Problem 2: Text Abbreviation
input: 1 string. Abbreviate sentence to initials.
Write a C++ program that receives a text input and produces its abbreviation. The abbreviation should consist of the initials of each word in the input text. For instance, if the input is "Computer Science Saddleback College," the program should output "CSSC."

Problem 3: First 'a' Word Index
print index location of first word starting with 'a' and print "not found" if not found
Develop a C++ program that accepts a text input with multiple words and prints the index (location) of the first word that starts with the character 'a'. If there is no word starting with 'a', the program should print "not found."

Problem 4: Last Word Extractor
print last word
Write a C++ program that receives a text input containing multiple words and prints the last word of the text. For example, if the input is "This is the last word," the program should output "word."
